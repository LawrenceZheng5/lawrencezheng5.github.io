### Broad Overview
Software engineering is defined by Wikipedia as "Software engineering is a branch of both computer science and engineering focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications." I would say I’m most interested in the testing and maintaining parts of software engineering.

### Testing
Testing is an integral part of the software engineering process because it’s when you actually get to see the fruits of your labor. Verifying and confirming that the code you wrote behaves the way you expect is essential. In addition, finding bugs and unintentional behaviors is crucial for having a successful project. I’m curious to learn and explore the various testing methods that exist in the world of software engineering. I also wonder if I could apply these methodologies to my personal projects, which often aren’t strictly software-based. Many of them have included hardware components, such as programming controls for a 5 degree-of-freedom robotic arm. I’d like to see how much of the testing mindset and techniques transfer to these kinds of projects.

### Maintenance 
Maintaining is also a crucial part of the software lifecycle. This is when software is released into the world and faces real users. Continuous updates, bug fixes, and problem resolution are all part of this phase, along with providing proper documentation. Documentation is an area where I need to develop more skills and find effective methods. Especially when working on an interdisciplinary team with a larger codebase than I’m used to, documentation helps pass on knowledge not only to future contributors but also to myself when I revisit past projects.

### Future
I hope to develop, of course, the “flashy” skills of designing and writing code, but I also recognize that the less glamorous aspects of testing and maintaining software should not be overlooked. I want to grow these skills to apply them in this class, in my personal projects in the near future, and eventually in my career in software development, particularly in the field of robotic systems.
