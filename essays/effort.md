### How did you make your effort estimates? Explain your basis and any historical data you used.
I made my effort estimates based of the previous issues and assignments from this class. For UI/UX issues, I could have a pretty good estimate based of the UI assignments in the past. When it came to implemented new features such as using a Leaflet map, I gave myself extra leeway for learning and researching a new library.

### Even though your estimates were often off, did estimating in advance provide any benefit? Provide examples.
No it did not give me any benefit. 

### Was tracking actual effort useful? If so, how did it inform future estimates or project decisions?
No it was not helpful.

### How did you track your actual effort (tools, method)? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?
I tracked my actual effort by using the time between the creation of the branch and the GitHub commit was made/pushed. I do not think this was the most accurate method as I would often have to stop an issue mid way and come back to it. Or I would create the branch and work on it another day/time.

### Reflection: what would you change about your estimation or tracking process next time?
I would change the way that I tracked my estimation by using a timer to ensure that the actual effort was more accurate.
