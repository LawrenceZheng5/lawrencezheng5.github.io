### I. Introduction
The role of AI in education is tricky. On one hand it's a new emerging techonology that students have to adapt to, but an overreliance on AI can negatively imapct their ability to learn and digest information. This is espcially potent in Software Engineering when a prompt can quickly give a student code that meets the requirements for their assignment. For this course, I personally use ChatGPT and GitHub Co-Pilot. 

### II. Personal Experience with AI

#### 1. Experience WODs (e.g. E18)
At first I did the experience WODs by myself and then attempted it again after DNFing/watching the solution video. However, I eventually turned to using ChatGPT to save myself time in finshing the experience WODs faster. 
#### 2. In-class Practice WODs
From what I remember I would be fairly lax with my use of AI for the in-class practice WODs because they weren't graded by accuracy.
#### 3. In-class WODs
I would use AI more in the in-class WODs because the pressure caused by the time crunch compounded with not being harshly penalized for not being exactly correct. I wanted to make sure that I did not get a 10% on the in-class WODs. However, some WODs were fairly similar to the practice WOD that I could recognize the patterns and be able to do the WOD without using AI.
#### 4. Essays
I used AI to mostly check my grammar and rewrite my ideas.
#### 5. Final project
The final project was "vibe coded" where I would copy paste the code that was revlant to the issue and describe what I wanted the AI to do. It was really a shoot first ask questions later, and when the bugs came after I would just ask ChatGPT to fix them.
#### 6. Learning a concept / tutorial
I did not use it for this because I would read about the concept from other sources on Google.
#### 7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
I did not use it for this because I did not answer questions.
#### 8. Asking or answering a smart-question
I did not use it for this because I did not need to ask questions in the Discord.
#### 9. Coding example (e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”)
I would Google what a function does when we were doing functional programming and would look at the Google AI examples so I guess that counts. 
#### 10. Explaining code
I did not use it for this because I was able to understand what code did by digging through documentation.
#### 11. Writing code
I used it for this quite a bit.
#### 12. Documenting code
I did not use it for this because I did not feel the need to document code.
#### 13. Quality assurance (e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”)
I often used ChatGPT for this when an error would come up and I had to debug it.


### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
I think the benefits of AI in learning software engineering lies in when you use it to explain concepts and show examples to first learn the concept. Then when you apply the concepts to write code, you can ask it why your approach worked/didn't worked and how to improve it.

### IV. Practical Applications:
I have used AI for engineering projects especially when it comes to debuging and researching topics within robotics.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
The challenge of AI is when you use it for everything and aren't responsible for your own learning. I fell into this pitfall for this class. AI could be further integrated in software egineering education by teaching what to add in a prompt in order to receive effective response.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
I think AI-enhanced education beats out traditional teaching methods, but only if the student uses it in a way to enchance their learning by asking the right questions instead of asking for an answer directly.

### VII. Future Considerations:
I think AI in software education is inevitable with the amount of investment being put into it. I see the challenge being the way that students utilize to learn rather than use it for the answer.

### VIII. Conclusion:
AI can be extremely valuable in enchaning a student's learning if they utilize it the right way. I feel like currently the way ICS 314 is structure does not incentivize the right way to use AI. The WODs put too much of a pressure on being correct over learning. It's easier for a student to turn to AI in order to not risk their grade, than to struggle and learn more and recieve a bad grade.
