My experience with JavaScript was very limited prior to this class. The most significant exposure I had comes from high school when I created an NFL logo guessing quiz game for my AP Computer Science Principles project. Unfortunately, that project has been lost with my school email, but even then, I wasn’t really writing JavaScript code. I was using code.org, where most of my work was done with block-style coding rather than typed syntax. Looking back on it, it was not an ideal way to be introduced to basic programming concepts and the language itself.

When I started working through the freeCodeCamp course, it felt like I was beginning from scratch. My background in Python and C/C++ from introductory Electrical and Computer Engineering courses made me appreciate the differences between languages more sharply. Certain aspects of JavaScript felt awkward and uncomfortable, especially the lack of types. Even though Python is also dynamically typed, I never felt the same discomfort as I do in JavaScript. I suspect this will fade with practice, especially as I work more with TypeScript, which builds in type safety and feels more natural to me.

Another adjustment has been dealing with the “bloat” I perceive in JavaScript and TypeScript compared to C. When I first learned C after Python, I thought C made even simple tasks unnecessarily hard, with much more care and feeding. Over time, though, I came to admire its simplicity and elegance. There is a certain type of directness to C that I miss when writing in higher-level languages.

From my perspective as a Computer Engineering student, it’s also been challenging to appreciate the strengths of JavaScript and TypeScript. I had never really considered web development before, so working with these languages has opened up an entirely new domain for becoming a more well-rounded software developer. I hope that over the course of the semester I will come to understand and appreciate their role in building interactive, user-facing systems.

In this regard, I’m optimistic that the Workouts of the Day (WODs) will help me more than the traditional approach of solving practice problems online. While I would still like an easy way to test my solutions and get instant feedback, I’ve already found the WOD practice format valuable. The time pressure sharpens my focus, and I enjoy reviewing the instructor’s solutions to see different approaches. I know I’ll be nervous during the actual in-class WODs, but I’m confident that the practice will pay off and that I’ll learn to manage the pressure while improving my skills.
