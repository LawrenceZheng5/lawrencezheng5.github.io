## Overview
*The problem:* The influx of new students to UH Manoa each year warrants exploration in the process of acclimation to the campus. With this year peaking in the freshmen class and the campus being quite large, finding certain nooks and study areas might be difficult. Certain majors tend to stick to particular parts of campus, so touching grass might be an epidemic.


*The solution:*  Therefore why not gamify the process of exploration, where students from all types of backgrounds have the opportunity to participate. It brings the communal aspect with a scoring system documenting one's attempts and while also discovering new places. 


## Name of Proposers
- Lawrence Zheng
- Jia Jun Li
- Joshua Chow
- Colbren Fujimoto


## Approach
For this app, we will create a location-based guessing game centered around UH Mānoa. Users can log in to play rounds of the game, where they will be shown a random photo on campus and must pinpoint its location. Points are awarded based on how close their guess is to the correct spot.


There will be two main roles in the system:
- **Users** – can log in, play the game, and submit their own campus photos for inclusion in the game.  
- **Admins** – can moderate submitted images and approve or reject photos




Some possible mockup pages include:
- Landing Page
- Leaderboard
- Game Page
- User Submission Page
- Admin Dashboard


## Use Case Ideas
- New users goes to landing page, logs in
- Options start the game, leaderboards, user submission page
- Users sees images of places around campus, and places a marker on map
- User receives a score for the distance
- Admin logs in, views admin dashboard, approve or remove images


## Beyond the Basics


After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
- Include other University of Hawaii campuses
- Include AI to give a short history of the location
- Users can rate if a photo is unfit for the game
- Include videos of a walk through of the location
- A fully interactive map with zoom
