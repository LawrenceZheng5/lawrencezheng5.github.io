<!-- Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) are a fundamental component of a computer’s central processing unit (CPU). They are responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. ECE 260 is a course on digital logic and design and the final project required us to design and verify an ALU that operated on two 4-bit inputs. This project served as the culmination of the semester’s work, combining truth table design, K-map simplification, logic gate simulation, and hardware implementation. -->

This was the final project that I made for ECE 371 - Engineering Electromagnetism 1. For some background this is one of the foundational classes that Electrical Engineers have to take, akin to ICS 311 for Computer Science. 

### Background/Motivation
Every conductor and trace has a characteristic impedance (Z<sub>0</sub>) as shown in the figure. Usually for transmission lines and antennas that is 50&Omega;. In practice, you want to match the impedance between load (Z<sub>L</sub>) and the port that you are looking from (open-port on the left of the figure). Essentially, the impedance of the element between the load and the output port (combined impedance of the `jX` and `jB` elements in the figure) has to equal to the characteristic impedance of that circuit. This is necessary because if the impendances are not matched, then there will be part of the signal that is reflected and thus the effective power is not maximized.

For this project I was tasked to design a matching network using two different methods. One method was to use the lumped element model where there's discrete components such as capactiors and inductors. The other method is to use distributed elements which consists of different configurations of tranmission lines such as series and shunt stubs. We were given that our characteristic impedance: Z<sub>0</sub> = 50 Ω, load impedance: Z<sub>L</sub> = 60 − j80, and to make Z<sub>0</sub> = Z<sub>L</sub> at 2GHz. 


### Design 
For this project, I was responsible for the entire design and simulation process. For the lumped element method, I first calculated the required Reactance (`X`) and Susceptance (`B`) values for the given requirements. Then I used those values to find the Capactience (`C`) of the capacitor and the Inductance (`L`) of the inductor. For the distributed element method, I found the length of the tranmission line and stub by using a smith chart. More detail can be found on page 7 of my Final Project pdf linked at the end of this page.

Then once I found the values for everything, I simulated the circuits in Microwave Office. This yielded plots of both the lumped element circuit and the distruibted element circuit. The following figures are for the lumped element method over 1-3GHz and 0-20GHz ranges:

### Analysis
At approximately 2.006 GHz, the magnitude of S11 reaches a minimum value of about
−38.8 dB. This indicates good, though not perfect, impedance matching. While the reflection is not as low as the lumped-element design (which reached −301.6 dB), it is still sufficient to ensure that most of the incident power is transferred to the load at this frequency. Compared to the lumped-element case, the distributed network provides a wider bandwidth. This is evident from the broader range of frequencies over which S11 remains below −10 dB, which is a common criterion for acceptable matching in RF systems. The phase response also changes more gradually across the band, suggesting smoother impedance variation with frequency. This characteristic makes distributed matching net-
works more suitable for broadband applications where consistent performance is needed over a wider frequency range.

### Results
This project was both challenging and rewarding, as it brought together the skills I developed throughout the course. It allowed me to visualize how the calculations and operations performed on Smith charts directly translate into practical results. In particular, it highlighted the importance of why we need to match networks in the first place.
